This script uses python 3.x.
1) Clone the repo 
2) Run `pip install -r requirements`
3) Run the script with `python3 BB_slot.py`


## Flow of the application

1) Make sure your basket is already prepared.
2) A popup opens the first time script is executed. Go to the login tab and login to your account using OTP.
3) Make sure you have chosen the right address. I have seen there is some default address on the website even when we have set it to our address. So after logging in select the correct address.
4) Click on "View basket and checkout"
5) Now sit back and relax.
4) Once a slot becomes available, a notification will pop up and this app will close since bigbasket allows you to make only one order at a time anyway.
5) Run the script again the next time you feel you're short of stuff.
